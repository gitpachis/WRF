# WRF-TEB

WRF-TEB ([Meyer et al., 2020a](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS001961)) couples the single layer Town Energy Balance (TEB) model ([Masson, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1002463829265), and subsequent papers) model, software ([Meyer et al., 2020b](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02008)), to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF; [Skamarock et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.5065/1dfh-6p97)). The WRF-TEB software is available for download from version 4.1.5 at https://github.com/teb-model/wrf-teb.

## Installation

The WRF-TEB software depends on the [TEB model software library](https://github.com/teb-model/teb) ([Meyer et al., 2020b](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02008)). Depending on the 'flavour' of WRF (software) you want to use (i.e. [WRF](https://github.com/wrf-model) or [WRF-CMake](https://github.com/WRF-CMake/wrf)), you may need to manually build the TEB model software library before attempting to build WRF on your system.


### WRF-CMake

No additional steps are required to build WRF-TEB using [WRF-CMake](https://github.com/WRF-CMake/wrf) ([Riechert and Meyer, 2010](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01468)) as the [TEB model software library](https://github.com/teb-model/teb) is automatically downloaded and installed on your system at build time. To install, download (and extract) WRF-TEB from the [WRF-TEB release page](https://github.com/TEB-model/wrf-teb/releases), then follow the [standard installation instructions to build WRF-CMake from source](https://github.com/TEB-model/wrf-teb/blob/wrf-cmake-teb/doc/cmake/INSTALL.md).

### WRF

To build WRF-TEB using the [official WRF model](https://github.com/wrf-model) (i.e. with Makefiles), first follow the standard [TEB installation instructions](https://github.com/teb-model/teb) to build the TEB model software library on your system.

Then, download (and extract) WRF-TEB from the [WRF-TEB release page](https://github.com/TEB-model/wrf-teb/releases), set `WRF_TEB=1` and `TEB_PATH=/path/to/teb/build` as environment variables before running `./configure`. From here, configure and build WRF as per [standard WRF build instructions](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/compilation_tutorial.php). Please ensure that both TEB and WRF are compiled using the same compiler vendor and version (e.g. `GNU 7.4.0`), and compiler options (e.g. `Release`, `REAL8` ) to avoid issues at compile/run-time. If you are using the standard WRF configure options, use `-DUSE_REAL8=OFF` when building the TEB model software library (i.e. `cmake -DUSE_REAL8=OFF ..`) as WRF defaults to 4 byte wide real.


## Usage

Standard/general [WRF documentation](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/docs/user_guide_v4/contents.html) applies. To run a case using WRF-TEB, first enable TEB from the `namelist.input` file (i.e. `sf_urban_physics = 4`), then rename the `URBPARM_TEB.TBL` file to `URBPARM.TBL`. Make sure to change options and paramter values to match your case study. More information about the options avalable in TEB/WRF-TEB are documented in [TEB model software library repository](https://github.com/teb-model/teb).
